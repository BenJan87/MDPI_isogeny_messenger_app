# MDPI_isogeny_messenger_app

The `raw_python` directory contains the source code of the cryptographic protocols implemented for the purposes of this study, together with the requisite mathematical functions.

The `desktop_messaging_app` directory holds the complete code of a desktop application that enables users to exchange messages. The application employs post-quantum cryptographic protocols based on elliptic-curve isogenies, integrated with the Double-Ratchet protocol.
